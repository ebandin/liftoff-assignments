### Overview
The Photograph Metadata Organizer (A.K.A. PhoMO) will be a program that simplifies searching, indexing, and file structuring a photo library. To achieve this, PhoMO will gather the metadata from each photo inputed into its data base. With this information, it will graph each photo plotted against 7 metadata PHOTOFIELD columns: Datetime, Aperature, ISO, FocalLength, Shutterspeed, Exposure, and Whitebalance. Users will be able to view the photos as a list, refine the list with PHOTOFIELD specific terms, and add new photos to the database. 

I also would like to include a secion for filepaths, potentially, and guide users to making file structures that can help organize photos internally.

A user will log in to one of three available roles: ViewOnly, Admin, or DemoUser. The database will come pre-filled with some photo entries. ViewOnly will allow users to test the search and list functions of the database, but not edit or add any entries. Admin will have full rights. DemoUser will have partial rights, to add and edit new entries atop the existing database structure. Once they have a role, the user will be able to sift through the views through a user-friendly interface.
